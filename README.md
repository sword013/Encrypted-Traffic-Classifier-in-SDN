# Classification of Encrypted Network Traffic in SDN

This project focuses on classifying encrypted network traffic within a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) framework. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Testbed Setup**: The project uses Mininet, a network emulator, to create a simulated SDN environment. Mininet allows you to set up virtual networks and test various network configurations and scenarios without needing physical hardware.

2. **RYU Controller Application**: A RYU controller is employed to manage and control the SDN network. In this context, the controller application is responsible for real-time traffic analysis. It receives network traffic data and processes it to classify the type of traffic.

3. **Machine Learning Model**: To classify the network traffic, the RYU controller application utilizes a machine learning (ML) model. The ML model is trained using a specific method described in the referenced study [4]. This model can identify and categorize different types of encrypted traffic based on patterns and features learned during training.

4. **Real-Time Classification**: The core functionality of the application is to analyze network traffic in real-time. As traffic flows through the network, the RYU controller applies the trained ML model to classify the traffic on-the-fly. This capability is crucial for managing network security and performance in a dynamic environment.

5. **System Overview**: The provided diagram visualizes how the various components of the system interact. It typically shows the relationship between the testbed, the SDN network elements, the RYU controller, and the ML model.

This setup allows for effective monitoring and management of encrypted network traffic, which is essential for maintaining security and optimizing network performance in modern SDN environments.
